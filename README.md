## ⚡ Fun Fact

I shifted from **public relations and the motor industry to coding** — spending 10 years managing customer operations and digital transformation before deciding to build the solutions myself. Now I'm driving change one line of code at a time! 🚗💻

## 🎯 My Unique Value

I bring a rare combination:
- **Business operations experience** (I understand what users actually need)
- **Customer success expertise** (I can translate technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders)
- **Software development skills** (I can build the solutions)

This makes me especially effective in roles that bridge **technical development and business impact**.
